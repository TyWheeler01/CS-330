Portfolio submission. Module 8
When designing software, I begin by analyzing requirements and breaking them into manageable components to ensure modularity and functionality. In my final project I focused on designing independent segments, such as lighting and camera movement, that worked together in my 3D scene, making the code more modular and easier to use and add on to. This project helped me craft skills in creating interactive environments and balancing aesthetics with performance requirements. I followed an iterative process, layering features step by step and refining them through various testing methods. These tactics, particularly modular design and incremental updates, will be valuable in future projects, ensuring maintainability and scalability.
My development process begins with understanding the requirements for the functionality of the program and then developing methods and functions to incrementally meet those expectations, which helps me ensure functionality at every stage of the project. In the final project I started with basic rendering in module one, making shapes and applying different colors. Progressively as the modules advanced I added features like camera view toggles, texturing, lighting, etc. Iteration was a key factor, allowing me to test and adjust each feature before integrating it into the final scene. Over the milestones my coding approach evolved to prioritize clarity, efficiency, and proper documentation, which made the final project more robust and easier to maintain even with all of the added features.
Computational graphics and visualizations have taught me how to implement 3D transformations, lighting, and camera navigation, which deepened my understanding of precision, iteration and visualization in computer science. These skills will be invaluable as I continue my bachelor's program, especially in courses related to game development, virtual reality, and advanced programming, where creating interactive and visually engaging applications is necessary. Computational graphics and visualizations have equipped me with skills in problem solving, optimizing code for performance, and implementing visual features. As a future software engineer these skills will be crucial for developing applications that require interactive user interfaces, data visualizations, or real time rendering, broadening the types of projects I can work on and enhancing my ability to create engaging and efficient software.
